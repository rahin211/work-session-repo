    <h1>15 Best places to visit in Bangladesh</h1>
    <P class="ami">Covered in greenery as well as undulating hills. Bangladesh echoes with the Muslim call to prayer as well as Buddhist chants, and is one of the most mysterious and wonderful lands in Asia. Bangladesh is the neighbor of India, but you will find a less developed and more laid back atmosphere here. <br>

        The country had a tumultuous past that saw it gain freedom from first the British and then from Pakistani rule. When you consider that all this happened in the 20th century, it just goes to show what a turbulent recent past Bangladesh has had to endure. As a result, it offers a slice of authentic life to travelers who want an untainted image of the region. <br>
        
        The people of Bangladesh are famously friendly and welcoming and the country is full of cultural wonders such as the tea covered highlands of Srimangal to the gorgeous golden sands of Cox’s Bazar, which is actually the third longest beach in the world. Other highlights include bustling cities like Dhaka as well as areas of rural paradise like the Sundarbans National Park.</P>
    <p>Here are the <strong>best places to visit in Bangladesh :</strong></p>

    <p class="ami">Spilling out into the Bay of Bengal is Cox’s Bazar, an area covered in salty fishing skiffs and bustling jetties. <br>

        This little town in the far south-east of Bangladesh is known for its stunning beach which stretches for an amazing 120 kilometers from north to south along the side of the balmy Indian Ocean. <br>
        
        This is the third longest beach on the planet and you will find local fishermen reeling in the day’s catch as well as bubbling rock pools and crashing turquoise waves that make this a great spot for surfing.
